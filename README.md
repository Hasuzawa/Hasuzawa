### Welcome

I am a frontend developer working in Japan. I am most proficient with React, Typescript, Next.js, HTML, CSS. I am still working on some personal project and polishing my skills. I am most interested in working in Typescript, Next.js, React. I design my own UI and draw some of the logos so I also have experience in UI, UX design. I can prioritise utility or visuals as needed.

For starter, checkout my homepage, summary of my projects.
